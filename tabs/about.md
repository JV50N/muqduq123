Greetings everyone, welcome to my little section of the interwebz. My name is Jason Goncalves and I go by the name muqduq (pronounced muckduck) on Twitter, HTB, THM, and other platforms. I finally took the leap and did the thing. I’m a fan of all things infosec and tech. I’m currently a Diesel Mechanic (roll that beautiful career change footage) transitioning into Cybersecurity. I’m now in my second year of university for a degree in Cybersecurity. I’ve participated in two CTFs for the NCL (Fall 2019 and Spring 2020); I feel that I did an excellent job for my first go at it.

Many ask what my username is about, and I always respond with this quote… “R is among one of the most menacing sounds. That’s why they call it murder, not ‘muckduck!’” — Dwight K. Schrute. I’m a massive fan of The Office, it’s always on in the background when I’m clacking away at the keyboard.

I’ll be using this platform to document my journey. My end goal is to make connections in the industry and, hopefully, find my dream job.

Stick around!
